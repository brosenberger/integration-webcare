# WebCare integration
External developers can integrate WebCare into their websites, CM - Systems or Webshops. Examples would be our Magento integration or modules for WordPress or Typo3

# Prerequisites
You would need an active WebCare installation to generate the needed IDs and files for your website. However, you can use our demo keys for development as the integration will not change (except for those IDs).

The demo keys for an organization are:

    Client ID: cac205cf-151f-4694-a7eb-4eadfe543cbe
    Organization ID: jeSnrpV83Ln

The demo keys for a single website in an organization are:

    Client ID: cac205cf-151f-4694-a7eb-4eadfe543cbe
    Organization ID: jeSnrpV83Ln
    Website ID: q68
